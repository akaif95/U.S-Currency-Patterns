# U.S-Currency-Patterns
The program is designed to make use of Regular Expressions &amp; Linear/Binary Searches to examine a list containing serial strings that represent U.S dollars.

A regular expression will examine each string and evaluate if the currency is valid or a counterfit. Two separate files are used to spearate the valid bills from the counterfits.
